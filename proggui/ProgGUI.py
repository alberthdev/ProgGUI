        # Check if a QApplication instance already exists.
        # If a QApplication is already initialized, this means that we
        # will have to do some interesting workarounds regarding queues
        # and multiprocessing.
        # 
        # This is due to the fact that with multiprocessing, on *nix
        # platforms, this is achieved with os.fork(). Forking means
        # creating a new process with a copy of the program's memory...
        # which includes everything, not just Python internal memory!
        # 
        # This includes PyQt's (and thus Qt's) C++ side, as well as any
        # other resources opened by PyQt/Qt. Copying Qt's memory data
        # doesn't make too much sense - if a window was open, fork()
        # would copy the window data... and that would result in two
        # windows.
        # 
        # Except that you wouldn't have two windows, you'd just
        # have very odd behavior since the forked process is trying to
        # access the same window on the screen, leading to weird
        # behavior and errors!
        # 
        # Hence, we need to copy only the data we need (almost nothing,
        # except for the queue), and work from there.
        # 
        # On the topic of queues - fork() works nicely though with
        # multiprocessing queues, since essentially multiprocessing
        # just pipes the queue data to the process.
        # 
        # If we are on Python >= 3.4, there's a new feature that lets
        # us configure how we want to launch our process - via spawning,
        # or simply just opening a new process (no fork)! Queues still
        # work (since it's just piping), so this lets us achieve
        # multiprocessing with PyQt successfully (and easily)!
        # 
        # If we are NOT on Python >= 3.4... then we need to play around
        # a bit. Thankfully, multiprocessing already provides a lot of
        # good infrastructure - we just have to write the way to
        # create a new process!
        #
